# Material Dashboard React type definitions
This project contains typescript types for [Material Dashboard React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-react/#/dashboard)
project (v1.7). 
I made types only for components, and the rest of the project is moved to a separate (app) project.
Feel free to use those types if you need them
# How to run
1. First run commands npm install and npm run build-package for template project
2. Then run npm install and npm run start for app project
